## What is Farm Rent ?

Farm Rent is a web application for farming tools rental and for land on lease service. It is built using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS and Google Firebase for database.

## Introduction
This web app based on React and Tailwind CSS is a platform designed for farmers to rent out their tools and equipment to other farmers who need them. The app provides an easy-to-use interface that allows farmers to create a profile, list their tools, set their rental rates, and manage their rental requests.

On the other hand, farmers who are looking for tools can browse through the available tools listed by other farmers, search for specific tools, and send rental requests to the tool owners. The app provides a secure payment system that allows for easy and safe transactions between tool owners and renters.

This web app aims to help farmers save money by providing an affordable solution for their equipment needs. It also promotes community collaboration and sustainability by allowing farmers to share their resources and reduce their carbon footprint.

Overall, the web app provides a simple and efficient solution for farmers to rent and lend tools, making farming more accessible and cost-effective for everyone involved.
