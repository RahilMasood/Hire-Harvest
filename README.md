## Introduction
Farmers often own tools and equipment that sit idle for long periods, representing untapped potential for income.

There is a need for a user-friendly app that facilitates tool rental, helping farmers generate additional income while improving resource utilization in the agricultural community.

The app provides an easy-to-use interface that allows farmers to create a profile, list their tools, set their rental rates, and manage their rental requests.

The app provides a secure payment system that allows for easy and safe transactions between tool owners and renters.

This web app aims to help farmers save money by providing an affordable solution for their equipment needs. It also promotes community collaboration and sustainability by allowing farmers to share their resources and reduce their carbon footprint. Also adding an additional source of income for farmers.

Overall, the web app provides a simple and efficient solution for farmers to rent and lend tools, making farming more accessible and cost-effective for everyone involved.
